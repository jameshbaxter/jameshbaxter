Hi, I'm James (Jim) Baxter.  
This is my GitHub repository for personal projects I'd like to share with the general public.

My hobbies and interests include:  
* Amateur Radio - Extra class license AK2W
* Flying - Single Engine Land pilot certificate 
* Acoustic guitar - I play like a true amateur
* Robotics 
* Astronomy 
* Machine Learning

My career has spanned component level electronics, commercial and military radio & satellite systems, programming, data analytics and predictive modeling, packet-level analysis, and most currently a log consolidation and data analysis and visualization product called 'Splunk', for which I am a certified architect and developer.
